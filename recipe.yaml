  summary: Automatic backup script for goate lab.
  description: |
    Using DSMC to back up files is somewhat complicated and it's difficult to track
    what files and directories have been archived in the lab. This script automates
    the process of archiving, stores information about the archive, and stores info
    across users for the entire lab.
